### QarnotDataSplit.ipynb
In this notebook, the original data is divided into 3 dataset according to the room they were collected. Each of those 3 datasets is splitted to 8 chunks such that each chunk contains data of 4 weeks. 

Feature "light" is interpolated to get rid of NaN. Some instances are deleted in "babyfoot" and "jacquard" in order to synchronize the  timestamps with babbage which have some missing measures.
